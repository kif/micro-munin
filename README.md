# micro-munin

Munin node+plugins written for micropython

## Idea: 

Use munin as data broker for domotic purposes and use it to generates graphs

## Hardware

ESP32 microcontroler boards are suitable for running micropython and provides many programmable pins to read sensors and connect to the wifi or bluetooth.

## Software

In addition to micropython, this is a server which opens the port 4949 and accepts connection. 
The protocole for munin is fairly simple ...

## Enclosure

The last thing to do: 3D printed case !
